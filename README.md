# learn_states
Learn all 50 states in the U.S.A with this game. Written in Python. 
The game prompts you to write the names of the states, and if correct, the map updates to write the state's name over it's geographical location. 
There is an 'exit' prompt if you are stuggling, and a csv file is created that tells you the states you missed.
